### Research Plan

[Link to research plan](https://github.com/YoranFox/datascience-portfolio/blob/main/NANO%20%E2%80%93%20Research%20plan%20(1).pdf)

My contribution to the research plan is done in multiple ways. At the start of writing the plan I layed out the general aproach for researching the project and also splitting the research question in different sub-questions. The plan for the sub-question *How does the given data need to be restructured in order to be useful for the model?* was written by me.

## Predictive Analystics

During the project I have worked on multiple models that could be aplied to our data. I did this to get a better understanding on how well different models work for our problem. When working on those models I documented my thoughts and systematicly went through all the steps. I also created the script that was used to create the data used in our experiment.

### Polynomial Regression model

At the first stages during the project regression was still a option we were considering, so polynomial regression is one of the models I worked on to try and get the best result. For the feature seleciton for this model I used a corrolation matrix (made by Oscar). From that I chose the two features with the highest corrolation since they were by far better then the other ones. First I analyzed the features, then I chose the degree of the polynomial regression by making a learning curve. After that I analized the model with the chosen hyper parameters. After that I finalized the model. These steps are all documented and analyzed in the notebook.
