### Research Plan

[Link to research plan](https://github.com/YoranFox/datascience-portfolio/blob/main/NANO%20%E2%80%93%20Research%20plan%20(1).pdf)

My contribution to the research plan is done in multiple ways. At the start of writing the plan I layed out the general aproach for researching the project and also splitting the research question in different sub-questions. The plan for the sub-question *How does the given data need to be restructured in order to be useful for the model?* was written by me.
